Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "ex13.py", line 3, in <module>
    script, first, second, third = argv
ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 4, got 3)

This error was given since 4 values were expected to be parsed,
but only 3 were given. Specifically that is script, which was
ex13.py, first, second, and third were expected but I only
provided script, first, and second, triggering a ValueError.
