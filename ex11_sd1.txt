According to http://docs.python.org/3.7/library/functions.html#input, the
input funciton reads a line from input, converts it to a string (stripping a
trailing newline), and returns that. When EOF is read, EOFError is raised.

So, it reads in the text the user types and converts it to a string variable
after stripping off the newline character.
